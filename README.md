Welcome to ClickerckerckerSahur – an experimental and fun clicker game project, where every click brings you closer to madness (or glory).

##  About the Project

ClickerckerckerSahur is a lighthearted yet technically rich clicker game prototype, developed as part of a creative collaboration between passionate minds.  
It's not just about clicking – it's about exploring the boundaries of idle fun and spontaneous programming joy.
